# Description

This is a Frogger-style arcade game written in Javascript for play in most browsers. The goal is to move your character forward towards the water without getting hit by the enemy bugs. If you are hit by an enemy bug, you lose, and the game restarts.

# Installation

  To run the application:
  
Download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository onto your local workstation:
- git clone https://github.com/Elektrobank/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git
- zip file https://github.com/Elektrobank/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/archive/master.zip

Open a browser window and navigate to the index.html file in your application's directory.

# Controls

  - Use the arrow keys to move the character
  - Avoid hitting the bugs while trying to make it to the water
  - When you reach the water (or if you're hit by a bug) your character will return to the start position and you can try again.
